## Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning and TensorFlow
### Aim
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of automatically detecting spam emails, thereby helping users keep their inboxes clean.

### Problem Statement
Email spam remains a persistent issue, cluttering inboxes and potentially causing users to miss important messages. Manual filtering of spam emails is time-consuming and inefficient. By developing an automated spam detection system, we aim to alleviate this problem and enhance user experience.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of emails labeled as either "ham" (non-spam) or "spam." The dataset contains the following features:

- Message: The text content of the email.
- Category: The label indicating whether the email is spam or not.

### Traditional Machine Learning Approach
1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted an exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and distribution of the dataset.
- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
- Explored the distribution of classes (spam vs. non-spam emails).
- Analyzed the distribution of text lengths in spam and non-spam emails.
- Visualized word frequencies using techniques like word clouds or bar plots.
2) Feature Engineering for Email Text
- Preprocessed the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.
- Performed tokenization to split the text into individual words or tokens.
- Applied techniques like stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their root form.
- Created features such as word counts, TF-IDF scores, or n-grams to represent the text data.
- Considered features like the presence of certain keywords or phrases commonly found in spam emails.
3) Handling Imbalanced Datasets
- Chose an appropriate strategy to handle class imbalance, such as oversampling, undersampling.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the class distribution.
- Experimented with different evaluation metrics that are less sensitive to class imbalance, such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
4) Algorithm Selection
- Chose a machine learning algorithm suitable for text classification tasks, such as Naive Bayes.
- Trained  algorithm on the preprocessed dataset and evaluated their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

### TensorFlow Approach
1) NLP Techniques
- Utilized techniques like tokenization to convert text data into a numerical format that can be processed by machine learning algorithms.
- Applied TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to weigh the importance of words in the email corpus.
- Experimented with word embeddings techniques like Word2Vec or GloVe to capture the semantic meaning of words in the email text.
2) Model Architecture
- Designed a neural network architecture using TensorFlow to learn features from the text data.
- Experimented with different architectures, including variations in the number of layers, units, and activation functions.
- Implemented techniques like dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.
3) Training and Evaluation
- Trained the TensorFlow model on the preprocessed dataset.
- Monitored training progress and adjusted hyperparameters as necessary.
- Evaluated the model's performance on a separate test dataset using appropriate evaluation metrics.
